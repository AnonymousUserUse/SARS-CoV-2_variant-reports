# Variant report 2022-07-20

## Dominant variants

BA.5 is dominating waves on all continents, together with BA.4 which is slightly less fit than BA.5 but with identical Spike so very similar.

BA.2.12.1 still makes up a good share in North America but getting replaced by BA.4/5. It's also present with smaller share around the world where BA.4/5 also replaces it.

BA.2\* that is not BA.2.12.1 made up 1-10% around the world at the end of June, with the notable exception of India where BA.2\* makes still up ~90% (and countries without much sequencing for which these statements are not possible to be made).

BA.1 only appears occasionally, in sequences that often show signs of persistent/chronic infection.

## Variants to watch out for

India has never had significant BA.1 circulation. Many fit BA.2* lineages are present there.

### BA.2.75 (S:K147E,S:W152R,S:F157L,S:I210V,S:G257S,S:G339H,S:N460K,S:G446S)

BA.2.75 seems able to compete with BA.5 in India. It was introduced or emerged later than BA.5 (first sequence end of May) and its frequency seems to range between 10-50% depending on state at beginning of July.

BA.2.75 has 8 Spike differences to BA.2 compared to the four for BA.4/5, making BA.2.75 the most diverged Omicron variant with significant circulation to appear since BA.1/BA.2/BA.3.

BA.2.75 does appear to circulate globally, albeit at such low share that it is not possible to say much about growth advantage outside of India.
Countries with clusters of BA.2.75 include: UK, US, New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, Germany, Israel.
Known countries of importation are: Nepal/India (for some Japanese cases), France (for some Israeli)

### Selection of other interesting lineages

Many interesting BA.2 sublineages have appeared first in India. Here is a selection of some to watch. That mutations are typical of BA.2 sublineages with (potential) growth advantages, in India and also globally.

## Latest developments

### South African pair of complex recombinant clusters

Two related clusters of complex Delta/BA.2 recombinants have appeared in Gauteng/Limpopo (bordering region).
The Spikes are mostly identical, the rest of the genomes have multiple different breakpoints.

## Trends

There seem to be two ways in which lineages evolve:

1. Stepwise accumulation of mutations with short branches
2. "Saltation" events, where clusters attach only on long branches.

In the past, all VOCs have appeared as saltation events.
Stepwise evolution does take place and is relevant for slow sweeps.
However all fast sweeps have been caused by saltation variants.
This is maybe not surprising as any variant comes out of nowhere and long branches are a result of fast growth.
It is thus not clear which way causality goes.
Shay Fleishon and his team in Israel are analyzing the daily updated Usher tree for new long branches allowing quick detection of potentially fast growing lineages.

Many saltations seem to derive from chronic infections as opposed to fast growing lineages so the ratio of false positives is high.
