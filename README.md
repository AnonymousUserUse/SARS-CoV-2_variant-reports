# Variant reports

This repository contains informal reports of notable lineages for discussion and monitoring within the Swiss SARS-CoV-2 virological surveillance program.
Weekly summaries of the virological surveillance in Switzerland are available as separate reports at [github.com/CovSeqCH/SequencingStats_and_Variants](https://github.com/CovSeqCH/SequencingStats_and_Variants).
The reporting here draws heavily on pango-lineage designation issues for content and [Cov-Spectrum](https://cov-spectrum.org/) for automated real-time snapshots.
